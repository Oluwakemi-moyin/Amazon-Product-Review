They feel cool to the touch, super soft, and breathable throughout the night. The quality is excellent, they’ve held up perfectly after several washes with no pilling or shrinking.

The teal color is brighter and more beautiful than in the photo.  When I first opened them, I thought they were going to behave like satin sheets (because they have that sheen) which I hate.  But they have a weightiness and what seems like a hidden texture that keeps them in place even as I move around.  They also have deep enough pockets for whatever size your mattress and topper might be.  I live in a warm climate and always sweat at night.  These sheets are truly cooling.  Never have I been more comfortable sleeping.Update:  After having washed the sheets I'm disappointed. The color leached out in places, and they shrank. I washed them in cold water and hung them up to dry.  Thankfully, I washed them without other items.  They continue to be cooling and that is what I bought them for.",TRUE,30,6/14/2025,United States

However, barely a week into owning them and they've started to tear around the elastic on the fitted sheet.

Cope,"I know a lot of people have made some great comments about these sheets and I understand why. However, my review will be based on a few categories that may help answer some questions I had before I place my order. Hopefully this helps others.Cooling: 5/5These are the best cooling sheets I’ve ever had. In fact, they are so cool that they may be a little chilly at first getting into bed, especially in the winter months. However, if you sleep hot like I do, you welcome the cool feel.Durability: 4/5I watched the sheets a few times and noticed that the edge was coming under slightly in the corner after a few washes. The sheets still performed to the level I expect, but they may be less durable than say some of the more luxurious brands.Feel: 5/5These are some of the best feeling sheets I’ve had. They remind me slightly of the Casper sheets, but much cooler-feeling, lighter, and silkier. It feels extremely nice being enveloped in the sheets.Fit: 4/5These sheets fit my bed well for the most part. However, I have noticed that the sheets do move more frequently than others. So, every few days (like four or five) I find myself having to make sure they lock around my mattress. I don’t fully understand why they sometimes come off the mattress because they have very deep pockets, however, it does happen. So, if you have a very thick mattress like I do you may find yourself heaven to adjust your sheets more frequently than you would like, especially if you’re not someone who washes their sheets every week.Laundering: 4/5These sheets clean very easily, however, they are slightly more delicate than traditional sheets in my opinion. So, I like to watch them with other delicates. It’s also a good idea to make sure you fold them if you are concerned about wrinkles, because they definitely hold wrinkles.Overall value: 4/5Based on the level of functionality and aesthetics couple with all of the different categories laid out above, I think these sheets are a very good value. Not only do I not regret my decision in purchasing them, but I decided to buy more. There are other brands that are far more expensive, and do not look and feel as good as these sheets. The value that you may have may be different from mine, but I’m very happy with my purchase.",TRUE,1041,6/9/2024,United States

I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I’m not sure how “cooling” they are - I would say they more regulate sleeping temperature for me, but that’s still a huge improvement from what I was working with before. The silkiness is not too slippery - so if you’re like me and hate those slidey, shiny sheets, these are not those! They are still incredibly soft and smooth; more than a standard sheet, but with a level softness that is unparalleled for me.

They feel colder to the touch and seem to disapate the heat well as you sleep.

The corner pockets are nice and deep. The fit is not snug at all, which I like. In fact, there is a lot of wiggle room which is better than drum tight. It seems they are durable but will be determined over time.I have a Nectar mattress and it seems to be a very “hot” mattress.

Almost every night no matter the weather I wake up in hot flash. I bought knockoff (didn’t know they were knockoff at first) silk sheets because I heard they help with temp regulation for hot sleepers and it felt like sleeping in a plastic bag. I was starting to give up on finding something that could help. I looked it up and found out the sheets I had were polyester and that’s why it was so hot (the fake silk is the super shiny blanket in the picture which I was very surprised about I always thought silk was like shiny asf but I was wrong). I realized I had fake silk and decided screw it I’ll put the money into actually getting real ones so I can really see if it works and it was the BEST decision I have made. My boyfriend slept over last night and we were able to cuddle the whole night without me needing to take the sheets off and move away from him from getting hot which has NEVER EVER happened and we both woke up so surprised. I was actually COLD. like deadass had to out on a pair of sweatpants instead of shorts like I usually do because it was that cooling. If you are a hot ass sleeper like me PLEASE bite the bullet and drop the $90-120 it is ridiculously worth it and I can finally sleep through a night without getting so hot. The sheets are also so soft and feel amazing while laying on them. 100% would recommend for anyone but ESPECIALLY for hot sleepers.,TRUE,101,5/20/2025,United States

A few weeks ago, I purchased a set of sheets that were advertised as ""microfiber cooling sheets."" We were looking for super soft sheets that felt cool all night and were good quality for the price. We used them for a couple of weeks and for the first time ever, I was sweating at night. Unsure if I was having post-menopause night sweats, coming down with an illness, or maybe it was just the sheets?...we decided to start with the sheets. After searching online, I found that bamboo sheets are listed as a material that breathes, are cooling, and help prevent night sweats. And that microfiber ones don't breathe and can cause sweating. I also dug a little into why some sheets are ""rayon bamboo"" or ""viscose bamboo."" I thought they were all just ""bamboo""...who knew? What I found is that rayon and viscose bamboo sheets are essentially the same thing. Both are made from bamboo cellulose, a plant-based material, and are less expensive and more environmentally friendly than silk. Both have a smooth, soft texture that is similar to silk. Bamboo fabric allows for ventilation and becomes stronger and more durable after each wash. And the best part is that it thermoregulates- keeping you cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather. Needless to say, I wanted to know exactly what I was purchasing because sleep  and my overall sanity was at stake!The sheets arrived and were a perfect fit for our deep pocket mattress. I was cautiously optimistic about using them because being in my early 50s, post menopause, I usually tend to be cold but have been sweating at night. I didn't want to sweat anymore, tossing and turning all night, but didn't want a ""cooling sheet"" to leave me feeling cold either.After using them one night, I understand all the hype. First of all, this is without a doubt the softest sheet I've laid on. My husband and I wanted the best sheets we could get with an on-a-budget price point. It definitely delivers on that. They feel durable and the bamboo texture feels like a premium quality.Second, for the first time in many days, I didn't sweat at night. You can actually feel the breathability of the sheets.Third, I give the sheets 5 stars on thermoregulation. We have a thick comforter and even under it, the sheets feel cool to the touch- not cold, but just right. And, I've finally been able to wake up feeling rested and refreshed.I highly recommend these sheets and will definitely purchase another set!",TRUE,246,10/25/2024,United States

While it doesn't change my feelings on the sheets, I appreciate the fantastic customer service!!-------------------Love the color but not sure I'm a huge fan of these sheets. They wrinkle at night so easily. I thought, the first time I used them, it was because I had a fever and was sweating at night. But, after washing and using again since then, they still wrinkle easily - and it's winter here in the Midwest. My house is about 60 at night. I can't imagine what these will look like in the summer. But more importantly for me is that they seem really drying to my hair and face. I usually sleep on a silk pillowcase, but decided to use the ones that came with this set for a few nights since someone else had said it played nice with their skin and hair. Each morning, my skin felt extra dry and the ends of my hair looked fried. If it helps to know, my hair is long and about 3/4 down my back. So my hair gets a bit wild at night. I was specifically looking for sheets that would do less damage to my hair at night and trusted the wrong review. I don't think these are it. I'll be keeping them now that I've used them for a few weeks but will probably look for a silk set. Im assuming it's the moisture wicking part of these sheets that don't do well for dry skin and hair - especially in the winter. If that's important to you too, I hope this helps.",TRUE,20,3/8/2025,United States

I actually really like these sheets! Sheets can be super expensive. I bought these initially because I really was looking for some more affordable options. I love how soft they are and they are also extremely cooling! The two notes I have are 1) they are so soft that they don’t grip to the mattress so I did have to buy some hooks that purposefully keeps sheets like that from slipping off the mattress 2) the colors are wildly inaccurate. That didn’t matter all that much to me because it still worked for my purpose. But the pink I bought was labeled as mauve and yet was more of a cotton candy pink. In the photo I attached, the pillowcases were some I bought separately and are what I would call mauve. You can see how cotton candy pink the sheets are in comparison.Overall I love these sheets though!

As the weather warms up, we need more ways to keep cool, especially at night while sleeping when we can't leave all the doors wide open. These sheets do make us feel cooler than any others we've found. We don't wake up sweaty and since we stay dry, the sheets don't stick to us. The only complaints I have are pretty mild. Since these sheets are so smooth, they're slippery. The top of our bed is not flush to a wall, so there's a little room for the pillows to move. I tend to sleep on the bottom edge of my pillow, so with these sheets, the pillow keeps slipping out from under my head. Not a big deal, really. I just need to either learn to use my pillow how it's intended or stuff something behind it so there's nowhere for it to go. The other complaint is purely cosmetic, and it's the wrinkles. I have never seen sheets wrinkle like this before. I attached a pic that was taken after the first night sleeping on them. We're not entering a Better Homes & Garden photo shoot, so it's not a big deal. Just thought I'd mention it in case others may find it unacceptable. At least I know that next time I wash them I won't bother folding them nicely. I'll save myself the trouble and just store them all wadded up in a ball!

I bought these after reading a comment on a competitor's page about these Bedsure bamboo sheets outperforming the other's, plus they were a little cheaper! I thought I'd give them a shot, but after only 2 nights of use, I have decided I will be returning them and trying the original brand I was looking at. Here's why:* As you can see from the first and second picture, these sheets are very easily wrinkled. The first picture is straight from the dryer to my bed, never been slept in-- and I used wool dryer balls, too!* The second picture shows both wrinkles from a single night of sleeping AND the fact that this color (sage green) somehow excessively absorbs oil, which I can only assume came from my moisturizer because I sleep with a silk cap on my head.* The third picture further illustrates that these sheets do *not* do well at looking clean after minimal use. This picture was also taken after one night of sleeping on these sheets. My eyes tear up when I get tired. A single tear made it onto the pillowcase, and I ended up with that. There are several more this morning, after sleeping on the sheets for a second night.* These sheets aren't very silky or soft.* The color in real life (sage green) is nowhere near as vibrant as it is in the stock photos. It still matches my bedding, but not as nice of a color.That said, I will say that they *do* seem to do a good job of helping me keep from getting overheated! I wouldn't venture so far as to call them *cooling*, but they definitely don't seem to make me any hotter, which was very nice!

We were hoping to stick to bamboo sheets but did not want to pay for pricey ones this time around as we are planning to switch from a Queen to a King bed within the next year, and new Queen sheets would not even have been on our shopping list had our existing ones not ripped. I was happy to find such well-reviewed ones for such an affordable price here on Amazon.As an avid user of various brands of bamboo sheets for the past decade, I found that these were great sheets for the price. While you can definitely get ones that are even softer, silkier, and more luxurious - they are typically over $100 and for under $50 (at the time of my purchase), these were definitely a steal. Great quality and softness for the price and as a bonus, my husband, who is a hot sleeper, has found them to be as cooling as most other bamboo sheets we have owned. We sleep well on these sheets and are pleased with how easily they fit our 14"" mattress. Two washes later, they haven't shrunk either.My only complaint is that the seam of the pillowcases WRINKLE and bunch up like crazy after going through the washer and dryer (see: photos I posted). It's just the seams (where the material folds over) - nothing else, and so it looks extremely weird and since I've never had to iron my sheets in my life, I don't intend to start now. I've taken to just flipping the pillows the other way around so that no one can see the wrinkly seams. I've never had this happen to me with any other pillowcases before! If it wasn't for the fact that we are upgrading to a king bed soon and are going to have different sheets anyway, I'm sure it would bother me more.Not sure if any others experienced this with their pillowcases or if it was just us!We are otherwise satisfied with our purchase, and if we were less lazy/busy, would just iron the wrinkled seams.",TRUE,13,1/3/2021,United States

They're super soft and not a bad price at all. I bought a set of the black sheets and the burgundy sheets for our guest bedroom. I like to keep 4 pillows on the bed, so I went back and purchased individual pillow cases in both black and the only option for red available, which the image looks EXACTLY like the burgundy sheets. So naturally I assumed they would match. No no, the pillow cases are BRIGHT red. Bright red isn't even offered in a sheet set. So I'm confused as to why burgundy is offered in sheets, but not pillow cases, and red is offered in pillow cases, but not sheets. I reached out to the store to see if this was a one off mix up, and they told me that their sheets and pillow cases are not manufactured at the same place (...uhm, why?). I will say, the extra black pillow cases I purchased seem to match the sheets just fine, so if that's your color you're probably safe. But going back and reading other reviews, sounds like you won't get a match with any other color.REALLY disappointed about this especially since I am hosting guests next week and went to wash the sheets. Pulled them out of the dryer and two of the pillow cases now have burn marks on them (which could be our dryer that we bought with the house, it's old as hell so I'm not going to ding the store for that). BUT NOW I CAN'T BUY REPLACEMENT PILLOW CASES WITHOUT BUYING A WHOLE SHEET SET!I also saw other reviews complaining about shrinkage after wash. Yes, that does happen, but the store does say that directly on their listing. So that I don't really care about either, didn't notice it as an issue with my fitted sheet, maybe just the pillow cases.",TRUE,8,8/4/2023,United States

I use them in the summer and winter with a duvet comforter, and they keep my night sweats at bay LOL. They’re pretty much wrinkle free when they come out of the dryer, but I also use dryer balls when drying them so that might be the reason as to why they are so crisp.

As soon as I got them I washed them in cold water in the delicate cycle and put them in the dryer on light heat.

The device turns off when unplugged, even when fully charged.  You can hold the power button on the speaker to turn off if it is on. For the initial test I used the 31-inch long hard wired USB hookup.  The wire is permanent on the device, but comes wrapped in it's own circular slot on the speaker phone, which is a nice compact feature.  For a Teams meeting, this device recognizes that and you can control the mic mute using your Teams mic icon.  When doing so, the speaker turns it's mic red so you are aware if it is on (very important for those side remarks).  The Bluetooth pairing shows up as ""Yealink CP700"" after holding down the Bluetooth symbol on the device for a few seconds.  An English voice tells you that it is in pairing mode and when paired.  I hosted a Teams meeting via PC built-in Bluetooth and it looked like that the device functions differently than the wired connection.  When muting the mic in the Teams app, the speakerphone did not reflect that and did NOT turn the mic on the device red nor the lighted ring red like the wired connection.  Although, it did appear that you were muted when talking.  The Teams light was not lighted either despite being connected to a Teams meeting via Bluetooth.  The instructions indicate it should work the same.  I plugged the USB cord back in and only then did the mic & ring show red and the Teams light up on the speakerphone.  Keep this in mind.  I docked a star due to this connection difference.  The sound quality is nice and you can control it by tapping on the ""+/-"" on the speakerphone.  Power save mode is invoked after about 90 seconds of inactivity.  The battery is supposed to last up to 9 hours.  Nice round zippered case for portability.

In particular, they make great headsets--arguably the best value in the market.  They've now got a very broad catalog that includes earbuds, headphones, headsets--and speakerphones--among other things.I have to tell you that I was very resistant Initially to these speakerphone 'pucks'.  Actually, I hated the very idea of them.  I had a Bluetooth headset for the computer, a Bluetooth earpiece for other situations and speakerphone connectivity in my car.  I do my best to avoid meetings and when I can't avoid them I'm typically the only person on my end.  I've got other devices for music so I didn't really see much need for the speakerphone devices.Historically, speakerphones in general have been awful to deal with.  Until recently, the call quality was so bad that it was considered downright rude to make a call on a speakerphone.  Even so, there were blowhards that considered it a 'power move' to do so.  If you were on the other end of a call like this it was brutal--you got to listen to the aforementioned blowhard's echo ridden bloviation.  If you managed to get a word in edgewise, invariably you couldn't be heard clearly and it wouldn't be long before Mr. Blowhard was cutting you off and talking over you.Fast forward to a couple of years ago--someone gave me a speakerphone puck made by a well regarded brand as a gift.  I told they guy I would try it out and to my surprise it was extremely useful.  Call quality was excellent on both ends of the conversation.  It interfaced nicely with the various desktop assistants and was a decent option for music.  I started to view it as the 'Swiss Army Knife' of remote working audio.  It could handle just about anything.Now I won't leave home--or even walk into my office--without this type of device.  In fact, this Yealink CP700 now my dedicated office 'puck'.  It can stand 'toe to toe' in terms of quality with any similar device on the market.  Where this device *really* shines is when you have multiple call participants in your office with you.  It has 360 degree voice pickup and a full duplex microphone.  Two omnidirectional microphones miss very little from anyone involved in the call.  I've tried more of this type of device that I can count and this might very well be the best available for multiple voice/conference call situations.You can connect this speaker via USB-A or Bluetooth and connected to just about any device imaginable.  I've used it with a few different cellphones, my desktop computer and my laptop computer.  The interface is really simple yet highly functional with sleek touch sensor buttons that let you control all of the relevant functions.  It looks as good as it performs.  All the better--the device is surprisingly small and weighs less than a pound.  Just an excellent speakerphone for multiple use cases.  Highly recommended!",FALSE,1,11/25/2022,United States

R. Simons,"I work in an environment where I use a VOIP softphone all day long. I normally use a headset, but I find sometimes I don't want to have anything on my head. I got this speakerphone so that I could be able to take calls without a headset. It has worked wonderfully for my needs and made my work day more comfortable.I use this via the USB connection. You just connect the speakerphone, turn it on, and then you are ready to go. Of course, you should go to the Yealink website and download the desktop software to get firmware updates (I believe there is one available right away). After that, go to the Sound Settings on your computer and make sure that the speaker is set to be the default speaker and mic. After that, everything works as you would expect.You can also connect this to your computer via Bluetooth. It does have rechargeable battery built-in. I find that wired connections work better in general so I default to those. I also have and use Microsoft Teams with this speaker, and I find Teams works well with this speakerphone in one-one-calls, but for group meetings sometimes the speaker does not like to be selected. Restarting Teams or your computer usually fixes this.I have only had that issue come up twice, but it was a little annoying. The speaker works fine otherwise. It has a built-in volume control, and also indication via a blue, green, or red ring of Bluetooth, volume up and down, and mute respectively.This speakerphone is a little on the pricey side, but given that you are getting wireless and wired connectivity and a built-in microphone, it is along what you would pay for other speakerphones, especially from companies like Jabra. You get the noise filtering and other features you would expect and also native support for teams. For what I needed, this is the perfect option to save my head from discomfort caused from wearing a headset all day. Sound is clear and crisp, and others hear me just fine.

In my hybrid work setup, this is the best solution I've used. I spend my working days at home or in the office, and when I'm in the office I frequently take calls in conference rooms where there isn't a phone/audio setup. I use this for all my calls, and I love it. First, this is not cheaply made. It has some heft and is a solid unit. Second, the audio is clear on both ends. The mic picks up voices cleanly and the speaker is clear, though I wish it was louder (more on that later). The controls are really nice - they're touch screen type, not physical buttons, which took some getting used to, but I like it. Other notes are that it's nice it has a battery to use as a portable Bluetooth speakerphone, and the stand that pops out the back is a real nice touch - it's sturdy and doesn't show signs of breaking.  Last note, this is plug-and-play. No drivers needed to install, and it works right out the gate.A couple things I think could be better: 1. as I mentioned the speaker could be louder. Many times, people on calls will be very quiet and are hard to hear and I find myself cranking it up to the loudest setting. 2. (This one is very nitpicky) the battery indicator light doesn't turn off (or I haven't figured out how to make it go away). This is a green light that is always on and will either flash showing it's charging or be steady when fully charged. I'd go with a pin-hole light on the side to show the battery and keep that green light off.These couple items aren't enough to keep me from using this on a daily basis.

I wish I’d gone with another brand of cooling sheets that, ya know, cool.I’ve had these sheets on my bed for 2 nights. I’ve woken up 2-3 times each night covered in sweat, have had to adjust fans to cool off, and stick a leg out from under the covers. No, I’m not coming down with something, no, I didn’t turn the heat up. I’m a naturally hot sleeper.The sheets also get wrinkled like no other. The sheets are only for me, I’m not running an airbnb, but it sucks to look at my neatly made bed just to see the parts of the sheet that stick out look like they’ve been through a wringer.The color is nice, and they are soft and will probably get softer with each wash. The bottom sheet does stay on well, I have a 14 inch mattress with a 3 inch topper and the bottom sheet hasn’t come out.The top sheet almost looks like a twin xl; the sheets stick out 6 inches from either end of a twin blanket.Overall very disappointed, but I’ve already used them and washed them and thrown the packaging away.",TRUE,2,8/17/2024,United States

Pinholes have occurred with each Bedsure bamboo sheet set I've purchased. 3 sets are guest room, so aren't washed very often, and it's embarrassing for guests to have holey sheets. Unfortunately the price has increased, significantly, (in 2024). So I'll need to try one of the other, more reasonably priced, brands. Too bad, because I really love the sheets... just don't love how quickly they deteriorate. Maybe it's a bamboo thing.

They wash up fine; like most sheets I've used that have this texture, they like to hold on to oils so my body butter will stain them etc but they felt so nice I didn't care.But after a year of off and on use (usually only during hotter months, and I switch sheets sets so it wasn't a year of non-stop use) I'm going to have to toss the fitted sheet. It seems to have worn thin very quickly and it ripped with normal use after about 6 months. I patched that tear with an iron on patch but it developed another rip nearby... Patched that one, and once one of the the iron on patches detached (whether this was due to the patch or the sheet texture idk) I stitched up the tears, sewed fabric patches on top, and thought it would be good for a while. Then as I was straightening up the fitted sheet the other side tore as I pulled it tight, leaving a huge rip on that side. It's just not worth fixing at this point. Very disappointing but they are pretty thin sheets so I guess it's not the most shocking thing in the world.I won't buy them again because I need my sheets to last longer than a year, but they were nice while they lasted.",TRUE,20,9/13/2024,United States

I love these. They are the smoothest, the softest, the coolest sheets I've ever had. They're very pretty. When you throw the sheet up to lay it on the bed, it ripples in the air and takes a while to settle like an expensive high thread count cotton sheet does. I've been using a single set of these exclusively for THREE YEARS and they look more or less the same as when I bought them, despite being washed and dried weekly. There is no sign of wear and tear on them that I can spot. Perhaps they're a bit darker than when I bought them? The only flaw I can think of is that if you don't immediately put them on the bed fresh out of the dryer, they wrinkle hideously. But in their defense, they don't ""hold"" the wrinkles. If you put them on the bed wrinkled, they mostly smooth themselves out in a day.

The first set arrived damaged or was damaged during the first laundering and they were laundered as specified.Pros:Fitted sheet is deep. Sheets are smooth and remind me of a high quality cotton. Workmanship seems to be of decent quality as the seams are holding up.Cons:Flat sheet barely covers the bed with almost no overhang. Would have thought they’d at least be a little longer/wider since they’re made for deep mattresses. Cannot be tucked at foot without losing too much length and barely coming to your chest.Fabric stains easily. Sweat stains, drool (because most of us drool in our sleep even if we don’t want to admit it). Everything stains these and washing does nothing to help.Fabric quality itself is very low. The sheets don’t stand up to weekly washings. I’ve had these for a few months and they are on my bed every other week and washed. The fabric no longer has the sheen it had when first purchased. They’ve discolored significantly. They do not feel cooler than cotton or have a cooling effect for more than a few moments. The value is absolutely not good.

I thought they would be like cotton sheets at best, but to me, they actually feel softer and more comfortable than cotton.For reference, I'm autistic and have issues with any materials that are scratchy or uncomfortable. When I bought these I was hoping for the best, but rather expected that I wouldn't be able to tolerate them. Wow was I wrong! These are amazing! So soft and comfortable, I'm switching to bamboo permanently.I definitely recommend these to anyone that has a sensitivity to materials and fabrics.Update (One Year Later): We had a threadbare, but comfy cotton sheet that was about a bazillion years old. It finally couldn't take it anymore and the fragile threads gave way to rips that were not repairable.BUT! That gave us a great excuse to buy a SECOND set of these bamboo sheets! The first set is still just as good as the day they first arrived, and going strong with all the softness we love about them! So I went to the page to buy a second set.I had already cleared the purchase with my wife, and bought a second set... But then I noticed that there was a great sale for them going on and told her about it... We immediately jumped on buying a THIRD set! We're not disappointed... They're the same quality and glorious feel of the first one. With three sets now, we wont have to sleep on any other sheets!

These sheets are thicker and the sheen is clearly visible. After their first wash and after putting them on the bed I noticed a few things. First: The band on the fitted sheet is thicker and feels more durable than my other sheets. Second: As I was laying down the top sheet and watching as the air escaped, you could see how silky it is because the air escaping from under the top sheet as it settled was like a smooth water ripple. Even after the first wash, it maintained excellent sheen and felt much more thicker and thus more durable than my other sheets. I slept on them for the first time last night and was very happy with the feel. It feels like I have been on the hunt for bed sheets that I am proud to own and I think I finally found the ones.

I would lint roll or pumice stone my bed every night, which led to the break down of my sheets over time. I saw these on Amazon and decided to give them a try, and I’m so glad I did. After my dogs move, I’m able to just shake the top sheet and all of their hair goes to the floor. Any hair left over or on the sheets I can just brush away. They’re also bamboo so they’re super soft and cooling, which is a great bonus. This is probably the closest I’ll ever get to living hair free. Can I promise this will fix all of your hair issues? No, but I can say it’s a fantastic start.",TRUE,33,5/29/2023,United States

Once you get them washed and on the bed you will notice how soft and smooth they feel.Only concern I have is the depth. While the sheets fit snug on the mattress, 16"" depth means if you have a smaller depth mattress (mine is 12"") there's a lot of tucking required to smooth them out.Overall, the best bedding set I have used and at a great price.

They’re very heavy made. Most sheets you buy these days are see through they’re so thin. These are not. They are insanely soft and buttery. Buttery the texture, not the stuff you put on toast. I’ve found only 2 downsides. One being that they are very wrinkled beneath me. I don’t care about that at all, but some people do. So it’s worth bringing up. Secondly, it is so buttery soft that the top sheet will slide off if you tend to not stay in one place all night. I roll around like a chinchilla in a dirt bath, so it moved around.

Been using them for over a year now. They are durable and not flimsy or thin. But the fitted sheet has continually slid off the corners of the bed and doesn’t fit tight  across the bed. There is so much extra material on the surface of the bed. Almost like the material stretches after a single night when you sleep on it leaving you in a tangled pool of material. And even with all the extra material on the bed the fitted sheet still comes off the bed often.It’s not super comfortable to sleep on due to the excess material. But they are better than the other sheets I’ve bought in the same price range.Update: I have now bought this brand 4 times. I bought a teal in full size and two sets of dark gray queen.I really should have read my own reviews. But I purchased these again in white king. The white king sheets are super transparent and feel much thinner than the darker colors. They don’t have a tag to indicate the top/bottom of the bed. They wrinkle horribly and don’t really fit my 12 inch mattress with a 3 inch memory foam pad.I honestly don’t see this set lasting more than a few washes. It’s is soooo thin. Still buttery soft. But so thin. I washed and dried them before putting them on the bed. I took them out of the dryer and ran to the bedroom to put them on hoping that if I put them on while still hot from the dryer the wrinkles wouldn’t form or would flatten out.The white sheets are sadly too thin to be a good value for the money. If you purchase, the darker colors are significantly more thick.The dark colors are 4/5 stars. The white color set is 1/5 due to how thin the set is.

Could not smooth it out. Tag suggests a low iron if needed. Who irons sheets??? Even an iron could not fix this wrinkled mess. And then I noticed the seams are fraying on the edges. I'd give them a zero if I could!",TRUE,2,10/31/2023,United States

These sheets stained on the first wash. I don’t know what kind of magical unicorn detergent you are supposed to use that won’t stain these. If you want mine to test 40 different detergents until you find one that doesn’t stain, let me know. At least their customer service was very nice and processed my refund very quickly. Also, they are very cool to the touch but once you lay on them, they trap your heat in one spot so you are constantly reaching for the cool spots. Save yourself time and energy, go to Bed Bath and Beyond and get quality sheets that you can feel in person before buying.",TRUE,5,11/18/2020,United States
